# Distance
Distance helps you calculate the distance between GPS coordinates, in vanilla PHP. Pure and simple.

## Installation

### Using Composer

When using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) you can always load in the latest version.

```bash
{
    "require": {
        "ldebrouwer/distance": "dev-master"
    }
}
```
Check it out [on Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/ldebrouwer/distance).

## Documentation

This is still on the to-do list. The code is pretty well documented though and should autocomplete in most IDEs.

## Still to come
- Haversine formula support.
- Expanded unit support.
- Documentation.
